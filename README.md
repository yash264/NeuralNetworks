# Neural Networks
A neural network in machine learning is a brain-inspired model of interconnected nodes (neurons) in layers that learns complex patterns from data, enabling tasks like image recognition and natural language processing. 

It processes information by adjusting connection strengths (weights) and biases through training, allowing it to identify patterns and make predictions without explicit programming, forming the basis of deep learning.
